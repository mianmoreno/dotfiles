# Guix configuration

This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) package manager and the [RDE](https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/) configuration framework.  

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configuration of my users, hosts, and remote machines. You shouldn't view this as a [Guix channel](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html), and in fact, you won't find much custom functionality because I prefer to work directly on top of upstream community channels.
