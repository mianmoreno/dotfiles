# Dotfiles

This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) package manager and the [RDE](https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/) configuration framework.  

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configuration of my users, hosts, and remote machines.  

I constantly strive to upstream most of the packages, services, and features that I write. I encourage you to do the same so everyone in the community benefits.
