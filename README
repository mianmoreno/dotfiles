This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/][RDE]] configuration framework.

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configuration of my hosts, users, and remote machines.

I constantly strive to upstream most of the packages, services, and features that I write, which is why you shouldn't treat this repository as a channel. However, there may be some leftovers that don't align with some projects' principles that I need to keep around to meet my needs.
