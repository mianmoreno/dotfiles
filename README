This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/][RDE]] configuration framework.

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configuration of my users, hosts, and remote machines.

I constantly strive to upstream most of the packages, services, and features that I write. I encourage you to do the same so everyone in the community benefits.
