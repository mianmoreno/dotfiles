#+title: Quasar
This the nucleus of my computing, consisting of a set of configuration files centered around [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]], and the [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/][Nyxt browser]], all of which are structured as per [[https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Home-Configuration][Home Configuration]] and [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/System-Configuration.html][System Configuration]] to ensure a high level of reproducibility.

I also provide some custom services and packages under =efimerspan/= which you might find useful. To use them, make sure to add this channel to your Guix channels list at =~/.config/guix/channels.scm=.

** Lyra
#+begin_quote
Lyra is a small constellation, but it's noticeable thanks to its main star Vega, which is one of the brightest stars in the night sky and forms a corner of the famed Summer Triangle asterism.

This is the system configuration of my development work station running in a laptop. It contains basic desktop services and it's mostly kept very close to the defaults.

*** Vega
#+begin_quote
Vega is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. It's relatively close at only 25-light years from the Sun, and it's one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.
#+end_quote

The single user of Lyra, which includes all of the home services that I use for software development, communication, entertainment, among other.

** Cygnus
#+begin_quote
A very large constellation, Cygnus is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn.
#+end_quote

Main remote server which exposes various services to the public web.
