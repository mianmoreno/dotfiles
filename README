* Guix configuration
This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/][RDE]] configuration framework.

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configuration of my users, hosts, and remote machines. You shouldn't view this as a [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][Guix channel]], and in fact, you won't find much custom functionality because I prefer to work directly on top of upstream community channels.
